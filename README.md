# Capstone-Project

## Project Overview


## Business Understanding

eCommerce has taken over the retail space making it close to impossible for brick and mortar stores to compete with larger retailers such as Amazon, Target, or Walmart.  Over the years we have seen stores begin to close their doors due to the innability to keep up with online competitors.

Goodreads is an online social platform which gives readers the ability to share and rank their most recent books read.  Once a user marks a book read or rates the book, the platform will recommend a new book to the user. A recent study was done which showed 93% of customers will read online reviews prior to purchasing. 

Barnes and Noble is looking to understand what books should be showcased in their stores.  They are looking to get ahead of the game by utilizing a model which can predict the rating of a book on the most ppular book reviewed site.

Barnes and Noble is looking to rebrand their company by partnering with goodreads.  They are looking for a model to be created which can predict what a customer will rank a book before even reading.  A recent study was done which showed 93% of customers will read online reviews prior to purchasing.  By focusing on a predictive model, this will help retain customers by creating a new avenue of personalization.
